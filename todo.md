TO DO REMAINING

- [X] Information content legends
- [X] Add Drug interactions data to supplementary methods
- [ ] Check materials and methods to make sure everything is included [SCH - I have done this, but I would appreciate if someone else could check too, I'm getting a bit blind].
- [X] Add comment on ORA GO of prioritised overlap human/rodent genes to the text
- [X] Update section headings

- [X] Remove hub analysis from ARDS/BPD overlap (2D) - the methodology does not track as only 10 overlapping. Hub is too small.
 	- [X] Replace with MCL of prioritised list, as for rodent/human analysis (4D).
 	- [X] Update methods to reflect change.
 
- [ ] Discussion - tighten up
	- [X] GWAS under-represented in MAIC human analysis (Exome sequencing is not...) [SCH will take this as it relates to a supplementary figure to be updated]
	- [X] Comment on use of tissue versus blood - not enough human datasets to do a fair comparison. []
	- [ ] Focus on CD4 (helper) throughout - as CD8 is seen less frequently. In particular, Figure 2E accompanying text. [Looking at this again I'm not sure it's worth focusing on? Opinions welcome.]
	- [ ] the leukocyte signal [I have ignored this to a degree, would anyone like to comment?]
	- [ ] Overall, the language of the discussion should be examined to be more definitive [Chris and Prerna - can you have a look at this?]
	- [X] Update text based on changes to figures and figure legends and supplementary below.


Figures:

- [X] Move the overlap % images to supplementary
- [X] Reorder 4D by how important they truly are
- [X] Fix title in 1D
- [X] Colours for categories in the information content graph).
- [X] Add supp 8 D to figure (not 7 as originally written)
- [X]  Update Figure 2 D with new analysis (mcl of prioritised, not hub)

Last steps:

- [X] Update to figure legends based on changes
- [ ] Abstract, results and conclusions

The top hit in the human BPD gene set is Ras guanyl-releasing protein 3, RASGRP3, a guanyl nucleotide exchange factor has been shown to act downstream of the B Cell Receptor to activate RAS and RAP165, playing an analogous role to its family member RASGRP1 (rank = 75) which enables positive selection of thymocytes and activation of T cells.
