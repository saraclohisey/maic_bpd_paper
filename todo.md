TO DO REMAINING

- [X] Information content legends


 
- [ ] Discussion - tighten up
	- [ ] GWAS under-represented in MAIC (Exome sequencing is not...) [SCH will take this as it relates to a supplementary figure to be updated]
	- [ ] Comment on use of tissue versus blood - not enough human datasets to do a fair comparison. [Chris can you take this on?]
	- [ ] Focus on CD4 (helper) throughout - as CD8 is seen less frequently. In particular, Figure 2E accompanying text. [SCH will have a look but  Chris and Prerna can also have a go if you like?]
	- [ ] Overall, the language of the discussion should be examined to be more definitive [Chris and Prerna - can you have a look at this?]


- [X] Move the overlap % images to supplementary
- [X] Reorder 4D by how important they truly are
- [X] Fix title in 1D
- [X] Colours for categories in the information content graph).
- [X] Add supp 8 D to figure (not 7 as originally written)
- [ ] Update to figure legends based on changes

Last step:

- [ ] Add Drug interactions data
- [ ] Abstract, results and conclusion
