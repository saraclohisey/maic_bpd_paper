# TO DO

Manuscript

### Intro

- [ ] Describe animal studies
- [ ] Describe what we find (summary) 

### Results

Figures

- [ ] Characterisation of datasets for Figures
- [ ] Doughnut charts? Barcharts? Sankey Diagram?
        
    - [ ] 1. Human Figure 1
      - [ ] A. Inflection point
      - [ ] B. Tissue
      - [ ] C. Technique/Method
      - [ ] D. Gestational age
         
   - [ ] 2. Tissue and Cell-Specific Expression and Functional Enrichment
     - [ ]   A. Tissues
     - [ ]   B. Functional enrichment
     - [ ]   C. Protein MCL
     
   - [ ] 3. Overlap with ARDS
     - [ ]   A. Tissues
     - [ ]   B. FE
     - [ ]   C. Protein MCL 
            
    - [ ] 4. Animal Figure 
      - [ ] A. Inflection point
      - [ ] B. Rat vs Mouse
      - [ ] C. Technique/Method
      - [ ] D. Tissue

   - [ ] 5. Overlap Rodent with Human BPD
     - [ ]   A. Tissues
     - [ ]   B. FE
     - [ ]   C. Protein MCL

### Discussion

- [ ] Figure?
- [ ] Summary of results
- [ ] What DOESN'T overlap with BPD/ARDS in humans?
- [ ] T - cells
- [ ] Mechanical ventilation overall
