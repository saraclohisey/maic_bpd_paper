# Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia: A meta-analysis by information content of genome-wide studies of the host response

## Introduction

There were over 7000 very preterm infants (VPTI) in 2021 across the UK6 and around 30% of these infants were on respiratory support (defined in Table A1) at 36 weeks GA, indicating bronchopulmonary dysplasia according to the National Neonatal Audit Programme diagnostic criteria.6,7,8 Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), also known as Chronic Lung Disease, is one of the most common complications of preterm birth and is increasing in prevalence most likely due to the increased survival rates of VPTI.9,10 Antenatal and postnatal factors disrupt the developing lung leading to decreased alveolarisation, irregular pulmonary vessels, and fibrotic tissue (Figure A1D).10,11 The consequences are life-long - individuals with BPD are more likely to require rehospitalisation during their childhood, to develop asthma and to display delayed neurodevelopment, compared to VPTI without BPD.12–15
Genetics in disease.
There is conflicting evidence for a heritable component of BPD20–22and attempts to identify genes via Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and exome sequencing have had only moderate success; no gene has ever reached stringent significance levels (summary in Table A3).23–27 So far, no genes have been successfully associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
