# TO DO

Manuscript

### Intro

- [x] Describe animal studies
- [x] Describe what we find (summary) 

### Results

Sections that require numbers updated/checked
- [X] Systematic review and meta-analysis by information content
- [ ] Functional Enrichment
- [X] Rodent - broad - systematic review info 
- [X] Rodent - specific - maic analysis
- [X] Overlap between Human and Rodent BPD

### Discussion

- [ ] Figure?
- [ ] Summary of results
- [ ] What DOESN'T overlap with BPD/ARDS in humans?
- [ ] T - cells
- [ ] Mechanical ventilation overall
