# Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia: A meta-analysis by information content of genome-wide studies of the host response

## Introduction


### Question

Which genes are prioritised as being implicated in development of BPD in humans and in animal models.

### Heterogeneity of BPD


### Importance of BPD
There were over 7000 very preterm infants (VPTI) in 2021 across the UK[6] and around 30% of these infants were on respiratory support at 36 weeks GA, indicating bronchopulmonary dysplasia according to the National Neonatal Audit Programme diagnostic criteria.6,7,8 Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), also known as Chronic Lung Disease, is one of the most common complications of preterm birth and is increasing in prevalence most likely due to the increased survival rates of VPTI.[9,10] Antenatal and postnatal factors disrupt the developing lung leading to decreased alveolarisation, irregular pulmonary vessels, and fibrotic tissue.[10,11] The consequences are life-long - individuals with BPD are more likely to require rehospitalisation during their childhood, to develop asthma and to display delayed neurodevelopment, compared to VPTI without BPD.[12–15] 

- Genetics in disease.

### State of the art

- Current potential mediators of BPD.

There is conflicting evidence for a heritable component of BPD [20–22] and attempts to identify genes via Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and exome sequencing have had only moderate success; no gene has ever reached stringent significance levels.[23–27] So far, no genes have been successfully associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in humans.

## Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO – Human Code + CRD42024550657). 

### Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
#### Human
#### Animal
_•	Search Strategy – SUPP 
•	Inclusion and Exclusion criteria – SUPP__
A detailed description of our search strategy and eligibility criteria is provided in the supplementary materials. MEDLINE and Embase were searched on 24/05/2024. We included genome-wide studies reporting associations between genes, transcripts or proteins and BPD in both human and rodent models. For rodent studies, definitions of BPD study groups were accepted as hyperoxic exposure and induced low birth weight. We excluded in-vitro BPD models, and candidate studies (<50 genes/proteins). 

#### Study Selection and Data Extraction
Following deduplication, titles were initially screened using Screenatron (REF). This included organising the studies into separate collections of human and animal studies. Abstracts were then screened against eligibility criteria, with an independent author resolving inconsistencies. Full texts were retrieved and analysed for inclusion before extraction of gene lists for inclusion in MAIC. 

The human data was standardised according to HGNC symbols or Ensembl/RefSeq equivalents when no HGNC symbol was available. 
Animal data was mapped to human ortholog symbols to allow for comparison with the human MAIC results. 

#### MAIC
The MAIC algorithm has previously been described in detail (REF). A full description and the source code is available at https://baillielab.net/maic. MAIC combines both ranked and unranked lists, of unknown quality, to build a comprehensive ranked list of entities according to 4 basic assumptions. 
1.	There is a set of true positives (host genes implicated in BPD) 
2.	A gene is more likely to be a true positive if it appears in datasets from more than one source
3.	A gene is more likely to be a true positive if it appears in datasets with a higher proportion of replicated genes
4.	A gene is more likely to be a true positive if it appears in datasets from multiple methods or modalities.
